# Compiler++

**This software is still under development, run the scripts *at your own risk***

Compiler++ is a software that helps you compile stuff, saving you the time for finding those files and speeding up your development time.

#### Important:
Xcode *must* be installed **AND** at least opened once for this installer to run

## Installer:

Run this command at the terminal: ```bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paper1111/crplusplus/master/installer/installer.sh)```and type in the password when required. After this, numerous compilers have been installed on your machine, without you having to find them yourself!
